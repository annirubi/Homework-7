        <li>
          ArchiPark Studio team loves architecture of any size and purpose: from
          private houses to administrative, public buildings and shopping
          centers, From residential quarter to small architectural forms and
          landscaping. Creating architecture, we are not just doing a project
          and all its stages, we are thinking about scenarios of human life, who
          will live, work, relax and study there. Creating architecture is a
          multilayer process, it begins with a concept and then thins with each
          stage. We consider the path from general to particular and analytical
          approach to the process of creating forms as reference points of our
          design method.
        </li>
        <li>
          Modern interior design is the solution to problems. The tasks of the
          budget, functionality, beauty and much more. In creating interior
          design, we use an analytical approach, it allows us to design both
          private housing and offices, cafes, restaurants, bars, galleries,
          museums, etc. We proceed from the tasks that the client and the
          interior space pose before us. We are thinking about how to rationally
          use the implementation budget and create a unique design for a
          specific task.
        </li>
        <li>
          Items in the interior should be aesthetic and comfortable. Each item
          of your personal space should bring joy. Furniture should be beautiful
          in itself, it is a finished work, a product of the thought process of
          a particular designer, constructor, assembler, etc. We think about
          every item that we create, think about ergonomics, functionality,
          aesthetics, we love our every piece of furniture. Our design objects
          can be purchased at our branded showrooms located in Minsk.
        </li>
        <li>
          At a certain stage of life, a person comes to the decision to build a
          house for himself. All over the world, the process of designing
          individual housing takes a long period of time and is quite expensive.
          If you do not have the time and budget to create an individual project
          at home, we give you the opportunity to buy a finished project from
          us. Each of the projects that we offer was developed by our company.
          This is not a typical Polish or Lithuanian project, these are houses
          already adapted to the materials and standards of the CIS countries.
          All you need is to take the finished project, tie the house to the
          plot and build it. You can choose the constructive system of the
          house, layout, facade materials, roofing, and we will help you adapt
          the project to your budget.
